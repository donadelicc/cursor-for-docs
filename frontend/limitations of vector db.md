## Potential Improvements

### 1. Hybrid Approach
Combine vector search with full-text analysis for comprehensive queries

### 2. Better Chunking Strategy
- Use semantic chunking instead of fixed character limits
- Respect paragraph and section boundaries
- Remove headers, footers, and metadata noise

### 3. Multiple Search Strategies
- Use different `k` values based on query type
- Implement query classification to determine search approach

### 4. Context Expansion
For important chunks, include adjacent chunks for better context

### 5. Preprocessing Improvements
- Clean document text before chunking
- Add meaningful metadata (section titles, page numbers)
- Filter out irrelevant content (copyright notices, download info)

## Conclusion

The vector store approach excels at **specific, targeted questions** but struggles with **comprehensive analysis** that requires understanding the full document structure and flow. Consider using it for focused queries while maintaining the original full-text approach for broader analysis needs.

## Implementation Notes

- Current chunk size: 1000 characters with 200 character overlap
- Default similarity search results: 4 (can be increased with `k` parameter)
- Embedding model: Azure OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002`
